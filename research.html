   <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u745-14"><!-- content -->
    <p>There is growing evidence suggesting that lavender oil may be an effective medicament in treatment of several neurological disorders. Several animal and human investigations suggest anxiolytic, mood stabilizer, sedative, analgesic, and anti-convulsive and neuroprotective properties for lavender.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Investigation of the effects of inhaled linalool on anxiety, aggressiveness, and social interaction in mice showed anxiolytic properties in the light/dark test, increased social interaction, and decreased aggressive behavior [20].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anxiolytic effect of lavender was superior to placebo in 221 patients suffering from anxiety disorder. In addition, lavender improved associated symptoms such as restlessness, disturbed sleep, and somatic complaints and had a beneficial influence on general well-being and quality of life [51, 52].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Lavender affects human EEG pattern accompanied with its anxiolytic effect. It is reported that inhalation of lavender (diluted to 10% concentration) for 3 minutes increases alpha power of EEG as decreases anxiety and brings the subject to a better mood in 40 healthy adults [67]. Increases in theta (4–8 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz) wave activity may cause a range of general relaxation effects and can be induced by chemical and nonchemical techniques [68]. It has been shown that during inhalation with lavender (diluted to 10% concentration) in 20 participants, the power of theta and alpha wave activities were significantly increased in all brain regions.</p>

    <p>Among monoterpenes, d-limonene accounted for more than 60% of the total volatiles in the peels of citrus; b-myrcene, a-pinene, b-pinene, sabinene and c-terpinene were also found as the main monoterpenes...the percentage of monoterpenes in sweet oranges was higher than that in pummelos and loose-skin mandarins</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Heart rate variability (HRV) refers to the beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate...Under laboratory conditions, mental load — including making complex decisions, and public speech tasks — have been shown to lower HRV.</p>
    <p>Several studies have now suggested a link between negative emotions (such as anxiety and hostility) and reduced HRV.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>During D-Limonene inhalation: (1) the high-frequency (HF) value of HRV, a marker of parasympathetic nervous activity that is enhanced in relaxing situations, was significantly higher; (2) the heart rate was significantly lower; and (3) subjects reported feeling significantly more comfortable during D-Limonene administration than control.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Orange peel extract is an all-natural product and its safety has been evaluated [21]. In fact orange peel extract has been used in cancer studies for many years with no adverse effects [2].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In laboratory studies, orange peel extract prevented breast, skin, liver, lung, pancreatic, colon and stomach cancers [2-6].</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The results of the HRV data after exposure to D-Limonene and control were compared, and a significant difference was found in the HF value, as shown in Figure 2. The HF value increased 26.4% during D-Limonene administration (827.2±191.3 ms2 ; mean±SE) compared with control (654.4 ±163.6 ms2 ), indicating that parasympathetic nervous activity was significantly higher during D-Limonene administration</p>

    <p>In vitro and animal studies have confirmed that several Salvia species contain a large array of active compounds that may enhance cognitive activity and protect against neurodegenerative disease</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Salvia plants and their constituents can influence several biological mechanisms associated with cognition including their effects on amyloid-b, cholinergic activity, neurotrophins, oxidative stress, inflammation and anxiolytic/antidepressant behaviours</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cognition refers to mental actions associated with acquiring knowledge. It encompasses processes associated with: attention, memory, judgment and evaluation, reasoning, problem solving and decision making</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Central cholinergic signalling has long been associated with features of memory, motivation and mood. Acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter involved in cholinergic signalling, is believed to play an important role in several aspects of cognitive function and behaviour, including attention, learning, memory and motivation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>AChE is an enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of acetylcholine and there are several AChE inhibitor drugs available to increase overall ACh concentration. These drugs are based on the premise that increasing the availability of ACh at acetylcholine receptors in the brain enhances neuron-to-neuron transport and ultimately improves cognitive function [16]. In vitro and animal studies have revealed that several Salvia species and their constituents are effective AChE inhibitors.</p>

   <div class="clearfix colelem" id="u763-21"><!-- content -->
    <p>Peppermint is a hybrid of spearmint (Mentha Spicata) and water mint (Mentha Aquatica). The peppermint plant contains over 40 distinct chemical compounds (including menthol, menthone, and menthyl acetate) and its consumption safety was proven in toxicological investigations</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Peppermint possesses a broad range of biological activities including digestive, choleretic, carminative, antiseptic, antibacterial, antiviral, antispasmodic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, myorelaxant, expectorant, analgesic, tonic, and vasodilatator (Duke, et al., 2002, McKay and Blumberg, 2006).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The main pharmacodynamic effect of peppermint essential oil is related to its dose-dependent antispasmodic effect on the gastrointestinal tract smooth muscles due to the interference of menthol with the movement of calcium across the cell membrane</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Experimental group consuming oral doses of peppermint oil compared with control group showed an incremental and a significant increase in the grip force (36.1%), standing vertical jump (7.0%), and standing long jump (6.4%).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Peppermint aroma caused improvement on tasks related to attentional processes, virtual recognition memory, working memory, and visual-motor response.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Menthol (peppermint component) has lowered the surface tension on synthetic surfactant films in an in-vitro study (Zänker, et al., 1980). The author theorized that it may change the lung surface tension and its function (Zänker, et al., 1980).</p>

    <p>The CB2 receptor which was thought to be restricted to immune cells and peripheral tissues, has been well identified in the brain [11] and pointed out the involvement of CB2 receptors in anxiety and depressive-related disorders [for review see: [12–15]]. Recently emerging studies are suggesting that drugs acting thru CB2 receptors could be exploited as novel pharmacological agents in the treatment of depression and anxiety. Also, agents targeting CB2 receptors have garnered attention as they are devoid of CB1-mediated psychotropic adverse effects.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>CB2 receptor ligands have also been intensively investigated. Among them β-caryophyllene (BCP) a naturally available sesquiterpene is pharmacologically a selective agonist for CB2 receptors. It represents a dietary phytocannabinoid and the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has approved it as food additive (approval reference no. 21CFR172.515). It's widely found in high concentrations in many plants and spices such as oregano, cinnamon, clove, rosemary, thyme, and black pepper [22–24]. Interestingly, it has shown therapeutic potential in ulcerative colitis, neuropathic pain, endometriosis, renal protection and anxiety [25–29]</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The present study demonstrates for the first time that BCP given systemically is effective in producing a significant anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effects in most widely-used predictive animal models of anxiolytic (EPM, OF and MBT) and antidepressant activity (NSF, TST and FST). The study also demonstrates that the anxiolytic and antidepressant actions of BCP are mediated through CB2 receptors.</p>

    <p>a-Pinene, a Major Constituent of Pine Tree Oils, Enhances Non-Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Mice through GABAA-benzodiazepine Receptors</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pine trees of the genus Pinus comprise of more than 100– 250 species and are widely spread out all over the world (Judzentiene and Kupcinskiene, 2008; Inoannou et al., 2014). It has been one of the most popular plants worldwide because of their medicinal and aromatic properties (Lee et al., 2005; Yang et al., 2010). It has been accepted that these traditional and pharmaceutical uses of pines are due to their essential oils (Hmamouchi et al., 2001). Pine essential oils possess numerous biologic activities, such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, analgesic, and antistress effects (Süntar et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2015). They are mainly composed of monoterpene such as a- and b-pinene, 3-carene, limonene, and terpinene (Judzentiene and Kupcinskiene, 2008)</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>a-Pinene [2,6,6,-trimethylbicyclo(3.1.1)-2-hept-2-ene] is the major monoterpene of pine essential oils (Groot and MacDonald, 2002) and a hydrocarbon group of bicyclic terpenes with a strong turpentine odor (Bakkali et al., 2008). It has been widely used as a food flavoring ingredient (Limberger et al., 2007; Rivas et al., 2012) and was approved as a food additive generally recognized as safe by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA, 2015). In addition, a number of studies have attributed biological properties, including antimicrobial (Gomes-Carneiro et al., 2005), hypertensive (Kamal et al., 2003), antinociceptive (Him et al., 2008), and anti-inflammatory (Orhan et al., 2006) effects to a-pinene.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Recently, Satou et al. (2014) reported that inhalation of a-pinene produces anxiolytic activity in an elevated plus maze test in mice. They also confirmed the accumulation of a-pinene in the brain. According to Yamaoka et al. (2005), inhalation of a-pinene significantly increased rapid eye movement sleep in rats.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>It has been reported that sleep quantity, as indicated by increased duration of NREMS, is enhanced by various hypnotics, including natural compounds as well as well-known drugs such as diazepam and zolpidem (Cho et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2012; Masaki et al., 2012). In addition to an increase in duration of NREMS, zolpidem can increase sleep quantity by changing the sleep architecture such as changes in bout number and sleep state transition (Chen et al., 2012; Qu et al., 2012). We found that, just like zolpidem, (2)-a-pinene not only enhanced the duration of NREMS (Fig. 4) but also decreased the Wake bout (Fig. 6) and increased the number of transition in Wake to NREMS and NREMS to Wake (Fig. 6). Based on these results, we conclude that (2)-a-pinene acts as a hypnotic by enhancing sleep quantity. When it comes to “good sleep,” it is important to consider sleep quality in addition to sleep quantity.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although it is difficult to define sleep quality in rodents, it has been widely accepted that delta (0.5–4 Hz) activity could be a good indicator of the quality or intensity of NREMS (Tobler et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2012). In human and rodent, it has been reported that diazepam and zolpidem increase the sleep quantity in NREMS but paradoxically reduce the delta activity (Feinberg et al., 2000; Tobler et al., 2001). In our study, zolpidem produced a typical decrease in delta activity as expected. Interestingly, (2)-a-pinene did not alter delta activity (Fig. 6C), consistent with other natural compounds that show hypnotic effects (Cho et al., 2014; Yoon et al., 2014). Therefore, (2)-a-pinene shows an advantage over zolpidem or diazepam in that it preserves intensity of NREMS.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>By combining in vivo sleep behavior, ex vivo electrophysiological recording from brain slices, and in silico molecular modeling, we demonstrate that (2)-a-pinene shows sleep enhancing property through a direct binding to GABAA-benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors by acting as a partial modulator at the BZD binding site.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In conclusion, by combining sleep behavior analysis, electrophysiology, and molecular modeling, we demonstrate the feasibility of finding a sleep modulator. We report that (2)-a-pinene can be a useful hypnotic by its potent action at the BZD site of GABAA receptors as well as by its easy accessibility. In addition to hypnotic role of (2)-a-pinene, it has been shown to display a variety of beneficial properties such as anxiolytic, antiinflammatory, antioxidant. Most importantly, we can obtain these beneficial effects of (2)-a-pinene from our daily life (e.g., strolling in woods or inhaling essential oil). Through our demonstration on the hypnotic effect of (2)-a-pinene by oral administration, we propose that (2)-a-pinene could be a good therapeutic agent for treating sleeping disorder or anxiety.</p>
